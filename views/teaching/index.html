        <h1>Meet Your Teachers</h1>
        <p>
            Dr. Nate Martin and Dr. Jaden Factor teach at Ozark High School,
            where they bring their doctorates in Fancy Coding Stuff and
            Architecture to the classroom. They lead the incredible AP
            Freakonomics, Market Fraud 101, Coffee Robotics, IB Sarcasm, 3D
            Printing, and the best of all – The Art of Subtlety.
            <br /><br />
            They’re on a mission to make sure their students learn more than
            just the basics; they teach skills to navigate a world of
            complexity, nuance, and, of course, cutting-edge technology. The
            classes they offer are as unique and entertaining as their teaching
            style!
